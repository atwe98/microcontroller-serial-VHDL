# microcontroller-serial-VHDL

A VHDL code to simulate a microcontroller with a serial port.
The code was made for a VHDL lab at ENIB for Prof Kerhoas.
Details of project can be found in this link: https://www.enib.fr/~kerhoas/vhdl_cours_index.html

The project defined a microprocessor by coding all its components. 
The microcontroller is paired with a memory where all the code is saved and would be excuted when the processor runs.
A serial component is also added that can take values from the controller and send them serially on command.
